? Boulders can block your way. However, if there is room, you can push them along. Push the boulder out of your way so you can get through!
? You can only push one boulder at a time, so when boulders lie together like this, you can't move them.
? If a boulder falls on to a wooden platform, it will smash through. Push this boulder off the edge, and it will smash a way through for you.
? If you push a boulder onto spikes, it will break them. Use this boulder and the other boulders above you to break the spikes so you can crawl through the gap.
? Falling boulders hurt if they hit you! They can also block your way out. When you hit the next arrow crate, it will set off a booby trap with falling boulders. Just keep running to the left as fast as you can!
? Phew! That was close. Boulders can be dangerous but they can also help you by breaking a way through for you.
? Jump up to bash the crate, and then stand well back of the falling boulders!!
? Well done! Remember what you have learned about boulders, it will help you when exploring the pirate's caves!
? Hmm.. looks like you're stuck. You should have run across before the boulders fell! Try again by clicking on the "restart" button.
